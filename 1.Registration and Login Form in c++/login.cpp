/*
EXPLANATION :-
# found Flag: Used in both login and forgot to keep track of whether the username was found in the 
file. This prevents multiple outputs of "Username not registered" or "Username not found."

# : This is only used once in main and before each new input set in signUp, login, and 
forgot methods.

============================================================
file.open("loginData.txt", ios::out | ios::app); attempts to open a file named loginData.txt in write 
mode with the append option.

ios::out specifies that the file is opened for output (writing).

ios::app specifies that new data should be added to the end of the file, preserving existing 
content. Without ios::app, opening the file in ios::out mode would overwrite its contents.
---------------------------------------
also it,

if (!file) checks if the file was opened successfully. When a file fails to open (e.g., due to 
permission issues, missing directory, or lack of available resources), file evaluates to false.

If file did not open successfully, cerr << "Error: Unable to open file for writing.\n"; 
sends an error message to the standard error output (cerr), informing the user that the file 
could not be opened.

return; exits the function early, preventing any attempts to write to a file that wasnâ€™t 
successfully opened.
